# Technical Details

## Randomization Mechanism

The Password Generator uses Python's random module to ensure random and unpredictable password generation. The generator combines characters from different sets to enhance security.

# Password Strength Criteria

The generator adheres to best practices for password strength:

    Minimum and maximum length requirements.
    Inclusion of various character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) for diversity.

# String Manipulation

The random module assists in selecting characters from predefined sets. The generator combines these characters and shuffles them to provide an even distribution and randomness.
